name: bead-split
description: Splits tasks out of a markdown file (or a directory of them) onto the beads board — one file becomes an epic with child tasks, each child labelled into the right swimlane (auto-ok / auto-partial / needs-human) with measured evidence. Dry-run by default. Use when the user runs /bead-split or asks to break a spec, plan, or roadmap document into beads.

# bead-split

You are splitting tasks out of markdown onto the beads board. **The parameters are the text
the user typed after the command** (`<file.md | directory> [--apply] [--epic <id>] [--section "<heading>"]`).

**DRY-RUN IS THE DEFAULT.** Without `--apply`, write absolutely nothing to the board — print
the preview table and stop. This is the step that goes wrong most easily: a wrong label costs
one line to fix during the preview, but becomes silent debt once it is on the board.

## 0. The label rules — not duplicated here

Read **§0 of the `bead-loop` skill** (`.cursor/skills/bead-loop/SKILL.md`) — it declares
itself the single source of truth for the `auto-ok` / `auto-partial` / `needs-human`
rules. Two copies will drift.

Three consequences that apply directly to this command:

- A child task **must** carry exactly one of the three labels. An epic does not need one.
- **Never infer a label from a title.** The label has to come with a measurable reason,
  written into that bead's own notes.
- Cannot measure it → `needs-human`. Unmeasured is not zero.

This repo's board renders those three labels as swimlanes
(`src/webview/lib/board-swimlanes.ts`): a bead missing all three falls into the `unlabeled`
lane, which carries a warning flag. If a split leaves `unlabeled` higher than it started,
this command has failed.

## 1. Resolve the input

- The parameter points at **one file** ending `.md` / `.markdown` → process exactly that file.
- It points at a **directory** → glob `*.md` + `*.markdown`, **not recursively**, sorted by
  name. Print the list of files you will process BEFORE reading them, and say which files you
  are skipping and why.
- A path that does not exist, is empty, or is not markdown → stop and print the path verbatim.
  Do not guess, do not repair the path.
- `--epic <id>` = attach the child tasks to an EXISTING epic instead of creating one; when set,
  ignore the H1.
- `--section "<heading>"` = split only that section (see §2c) and ignore the rest of the file.

## 2. Choose the split mode — measure the file first, do not split immediately

Count the `##` headings before doing anything else. There are **two** modes, and picking the
wrong one is the fastest way to dump garbage onto the board.

### 2a. The "this is documentation, not a spec" guard

STOP and ask the user to scope a section if **either** is true:

- The file has **more than 6** `##` headings, or
- Any `##` matches a familiar documentation section name: Install · Requirements · Settings ·
  Commands · License · Tech stack · Contributing · Development · Related projects · Roadmap ·
  What it does · Design system.

When you stop, print a table: each `##` with the **number of top-level bullets** inside it —
the section that is really a TODO list shows itself immediately. Measured on this repo's own
`README.md`: 13 `##` headings, and splitting it in spec mode would create beads named
`License`, `Tech stack`, and `Related projects`. Garbage on the board costs far more than one
question.

`--section "<heading>"` lets the user scope it up front so you never have to ask.

### 2b. Spec mode (the default — a file written to be split)

- `#` (the first H1) → the **epic**. Title = the H1 text, description = the prose before the
  first `##`. The H1 may be HTML, `<h1 …>…</h1>` — READMEs often use that to centre it; accept
  both forms.
- Each `##` → **one child task**. Title = the H2 text, description = everything up to the next `##`.

### 2c. Section mode (guard 2a fired, or `--section` was given)

- The scoped section → the **epic** (title = the heading text plus the file name, so it is
  distinguishable), unless `--epic` is set.
- **Top-level bullets** (`- ` / `* `) inside that section → **child tasks**. For the shape
  `- **Name** — description (link)`, the title is the bold part and the description is the rest,
  **including the link**.
- Bullets sitting under a bold sub-heading such as `**Planned**` / `**Exploring**`: ask the user
  which group to take; do not merge both — `Exploring` is usually an unsettled direction, and
  splitting it creates fake debt.

### 2d. Rules common to both modes

- `###` and deeper: **keep them inside the parent task's description**, do NOT split them into
  beads. The same goes for `- [ ]` checkboxes and nested bullets — they are the task's
  acceptance criteria, not separate beads.
- Two tasks with the same title in one file → stop and report it: the title-based dedupe in §5
  would be ambiguous.
- A file with no `##` and no bullets → skip that file, say so, and **do not create an empty epic**.
- Cannot determine the epic title (no H1, no `--epic`, no scoped section) → stop and ask. Do not
  use the file name as the epic title without asking.

## 3. Assign labels by MEASURING, one task at a time

For each task, measure inside the repo before concluding anything. Keep the command and its
result to put into the notes:

- Does the file or symbol the task names **exist**? → `rg` / `grep -n`, capture `file:line`.
- Are the closing conditions **reachable with tests in the repo**? → find the matching test and
  run it for real if it is fast; read the **exit code**, never trust `echo OK`.
- Does it need **real CI green / a real environment / credentials / external cost / a decision
  from the user**? → if the task mentions a release or publish, read `.github/workflows/*`.

Then assign: `auto-ok` (closable entirely inside the repo) · `auto-partial` (the code is doable,
the closing bar needs an external resource) · `needs-human` (needs a person).
**Not sure → `needs-human`.**

Assign each child a `size:*` label in the same pass, per the scale in the
`bead-estimate` skill §0 — children are leaves, so nothing inherits the label, and an
epic whose children are all sized is the difference between an epic that can be forecast
and one that reports as `unsized`.

## 4. Emit a graph plan; do NOT loop `bd create`

Write the plan to `.beads/bead-split-plan.json` — **not to `/tmp`**: Git Bash maps `/tmp` onto
`%TEMP%` while Python on Windows reads `/tmp` as `C:\tmp`, so the write succeeds and then raises
`FileNotFoundError` on the very next line (the full reasoning is in §1 of `bead-loop`).

The schema below is measured on `bd 1.2.2` — unknown fields only produce a **warning and are
then dropped silently**, so use exactly these fields and add nothing:

```json
{
  "nodes": [
    {"key": "e", "title": "<H1>", "type": "epic", "priority": 2, "description": "<intro>"},
    {"key": "t1", "title": "<H2>", "type": "task", "priority": 2,
     "labels": ["auto-ok"], "description": "<the H2 body>", "parent_key": "e"}
  ],
  "edges": [{"from_key": "t2", "to_key": "t1", "type": "blocks"}]
}
```

- A node accepts: `key`, `title`, `type`, `priority`, `labels`, `description`, and either
  `parent_key` (another node in the plan) or `parent_id` (an existing bead — this is what
  `--epic` uses).
- An edge accepts: `from_key` | `from_id`, `to_key` | `to_id`, `type`.
- **`notes`, `acceptance`, `design`, `deps`, `depends_on`, and `blocked_by` are NOT in the
  schema** — passing them earns a warning and then they are lost entirely. Notes happen in §5.
- Only add `edges` when the markdown **states** a dependency order. Never infer one from heading
  order.

## 5. Preview (the default), and only then `--apply`

**Always** run this first:

```bash
bd create --graph .beads/bead-split-plan.json --dry-run
```

Plus your own table: `title | lane | the measurement (file:line / command + result)`.
That table is **mandatory**, not decoration: measured on `bd 1.2.2`, `--dry-run` prints only
`key / type / priority / title` and **does not print labels**. So it confirms the epic–task
structure but confirms NOTHING about the lanes. Your table is the only thing that proves the
lanes are right before anything is written.

Without `--apply` → **stop here** and print the exact command the user needs in order to apply it.

With `--apply`:

1. **Dedupe before writing.** For each title: `bd search "<title>" --status all --json` → if a
   title matches (compare after stripping whitespace), drop that node from the plan and report
   "skipped, already `<id>`". `--status all` is **mandatory**: by default `bd search` excludes
   closed beads, and without it you recreate the very bead that was closed last week.
2. `bd create --graph .beads/bead-split-plan.json` — keep the `key -> id` map it prints.
3. **Attach the notes to each new task** (the graph schema rejects `notes`, as measured):
   ```bash
   bd update <id> --notes "LANE <label> (<date>, HEAD <sha>): <the measured evidence>. Source: <file.md> § <heading>"
   ```
   Skipping this leaves a bead with a label and no reason — which `/bead-loop` is not allowed to
   trust.
4. Take `<sha>` from `git rev-parse --short HEAD`, so the next measurement knows the baseline.

## 6. Handoff

Before claiming anything is done, verify for real (the `verification-before-completion`
skill if your environment has it), then report:

- A table of the new beads: `id | type | lane | title`, plus the parent epic and the source file.
- How many nodes were skipped as duplicates, with the existing ids.
- A claim backed by a number: `unlabeled` **did not go up** — every child task carries exactly
  one of the three labels.
- The bead count per lane; for `needs-human` beads, **list each one and why** — no bare counts,
  no silence.
- The files you changed plus the suggested commit commands. **Never push or sync on your own**
  (conservative profile).

## Prohibited

- **Never `bd create --file <md>`.** Measured on `bd 1.2.2`: it **silently** ignores `--labels`,
  `--parent`, and `-p` (beads come out P2, with no labels and no parent), it accepts no per-issue
  metadata (everything after a `##` becomes the description verbatim and the type is always
  `task`), and `--dry-run` errors out when combined with `--file`. `--graph` is the only path
  that both assigns labels and parents and offers a preview. Do not "optimise" back to `--file`
  without re-measuring.
- No `bd close`, and no editing code, in this command — it only splits tasks.
- No todo tool and no markdown checkboxes as task tracking.
