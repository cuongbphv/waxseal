## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] - 2026-08-21

### Added

- Envelope-based SHA-256 audit hash chain: only the fixed `EntryHeader` is chained,
  payloads are referenced by `payload_hash`.
- Automatic schema fingerprints (`hash_version`) with an append-only registry;
  unknown fingerprints report as unverifiable-by-name, never as tampered.
- Storage backends: JSONL, SQLite, in-memory, S3 (injected boto3 client),
  PostgreSQL (injected psycopg connection), each with fork-proof concurrent appends.
- Redact-before-hash: redaction runs before `payload_hash` is computed, so cleartext
  secrets never reach disk.
- Forward-secure sealing (key-evolving HMAC, stdlib only) and injected digital
  signatures via the `.attest` attestation sidecar.
- CLI: `waxseal verify` (exit 0/1/2), `tail`, `inspect`, `head`.
- Integrations for seven agent frameworks and coding tools: Claude Code, Codex CLI,
  Cursor, LangChain/LangGraph, CrewAI, OpenAI Agents SDK, hermes-agent.
- `dropped_writes` completeness reporting, separate from chain integrity
  (`None` = not measured, never conflated with `0`).
